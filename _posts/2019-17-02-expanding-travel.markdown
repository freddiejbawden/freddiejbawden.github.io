Long periods of travel often get skipped over in role playing games; it's clear to see why;
travelling for weeks on end with not much to do isn't the image of adventure that players
have when starting a campaign. However I would argue that travel can add to the
immersion and scale of the adventure: it provides a break from life and death decisions;
 gives the chance for players to develop their character's relationships, and can
  challenge the players in different ways.

## Expanding Sleep

_The hunt for the rare Giant Ape has taken its toll on the members of
Spat Co.; they were ill prepared for the jungle and had been sleeping on poorly
built hammocks for days: Jayn was beginning to lag behind while Deveroo was not
his quick witted self. As evening came and the party readied for rest, they heard
a series of low thuds followed by a howl that echoed in the still air. Exhausted,
they knew that this might be their only chance to catch the illusive creature
for weeks, whether they were ready or not._

An aspect of travel that is often overlooked is sleep; even the most hardy
of adventurers suffer when sleeping rough for days on end. Tracking quality of
sleep can add a different challenge to travel - _should we push on through the
night to find a better sleeping spot, or bunk down now where we know it is safe?_
Sleep deprivation - if not looked after - can lead to players gaining suffering
 harsh effects to their abilities, movement and psyche.

### Rules

Quick note: I mainly play Dungeons & Dragons 5e, so some of the rules may not
translate perfectly into other systems.

#### Sleep Threshold

For every night the party are sleeping rough have them roll a straight d20 and add it
to the players "sleep score"; this is modified depending on sleep conditions,
weather and the environment. Everyday the players travel, increase the "sleep
threshold" by 10 (first day 10, second day 20); this represents the amount of
sleep that the players need. If a player's sleep score falls below the threshold,
exhaustion begins to creep in.

| Amount below sleep threshold | Level of exhaustion | Effect                                         |
|------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 10 - 19                      | 1                   | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
| 20 - 29                      | 2                   | Speed halved                                   |
| 30 - 39                      | 3                   | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 40 - 49                      | 4                   | Hit point maximum halved                       |
| 50 +                         | 5                   | Speed reduced to 0                             |


The effects of sleep deprivation are variable, hallucinations could be a fun effect,
however I like the preexisting exhaustion mechanic as it ramps up pretty fast and
is easy for my player to manage on D&DBeyond.

#### Improving Sleep

A player sleep score roll is modified depending on their surroundings, it is
mostly up to you to decide on what these are however a few ideas are applicable
in most games.

| Environment Condition                  | Effect |   
|----------------------------------------|--------|
|  Take a watch for longer than 1 hour   | -1     |
| Sleep is disturbed frequently          | -1     |
| Outside in the rain                    | -2     |
| Loud storm                             | -1     |
| Nightmares                             | -1     |

| Sleeping Conditions   | Effect |
|-----------------------|--------|
| In tent               | -1     |
| Hammock               | -1     |
| Bedroll on the ground | -3     |
| Without any shelter   | -5     |
| On wet ground         | -1     |


#### Rest and Recovery

In order for a player to reset their sleep score, they must take an entire day
of rest (no major activity). This will set the threshold to 0 and the sleep score
to 0. This reduces a players exhaustion level by 3.

By incorporating persistent de-buffs from exhaustion or your own effects can
make the players think more tactically about engaging threats, make combat encounters
more deadly or could be used to the players advantage if they are stalking someone
through the wilderness.

Granted, the randomness of these rules are not for everyone; I could imagine some
players being frustrated from having a pretty severe disadvantage just due to a
single dice roll. So as with every rule in role playing games make sure its right
for your party. These rules have really enhanced my game and made travel more
 engaging for the players.
